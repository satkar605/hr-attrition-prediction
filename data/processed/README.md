# Processed Data Directory

This directory contains the processed data files generated by `notebooks/01-data-exploration.ipynb`.

## Files

- `df_scaled.pkl` - Processed and scaled dataframe (pickle format)
- `scaler.pkl` - StandardScaler object used for feature scaling (pickle format)
- `df_scaled.csv` - Processed dataframe in CSV format (for easy inspection)

## Usage

These files are automatically generated when you run all cells in `notebooks/01-data-exploration.ipynb`.

The files are loaded automatically by `notebooks/02-baseline-logistic-regression.ipynb` at the start.

## Note

If you modify the data processing pipeline in notebook 01, you'll need to re-run it to regenerate these files.
